INaturalistIOS
==============

INaturalistIOS is an iOS app for iNaturalist.org. It's a re-write of the old
Titanium-based app, and is still under development.

Setup
-----
We're using RestKit as a submodule so there's a little more than cloning.

    git clone git@github.com:inaturalist/INaturalistIOS.git
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
