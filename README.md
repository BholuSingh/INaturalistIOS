INaturalistIOS
==============

INaturalistIOS is the official iOS app for submitting data to [iNaturalist.org](http://www.inaturalist.org).

Setup
-----

We've just finished transitioning to cocoapods: `gem install cocoapods`, then `pod install`.

You'll also need to copy `config.h.example` to `config.h` and fill in your details.

That should get you set up for local development with the Simulator. If you want to test on actual devices you'll need to get a provisioning profile from Apple and configure the project to use it: https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/overview/index.action.

Check out our [Roadmap](https://github.com/inaturalist/INaturalistIOS/wiki/Roadmap) for details on where we're doing.
