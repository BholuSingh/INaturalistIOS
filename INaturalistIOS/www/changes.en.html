      Recent observations will download when you sign in or pull down on
      the observations list
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Deleting observations in the app will delete them on the
      website.</strong> If you routinely delete all your local observations
      for performance reasons this will now delete them permanently on the
      website as well, which is probably not what you want. You can achieve
      the same effect by signing out and signing back in.
